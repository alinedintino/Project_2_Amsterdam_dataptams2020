## Project Description
In this project you will present an analysis of a topic of your choosing related to the city of Amsterdam.

Possible topics are:  
* Transportation
* Urban environment
* Population
* Administration
* Economics & business

In this project you will work in **teams**. Your team must come to an agreement with the other teams so that each of you work on a different topic.

Possible datasets you can use are suggested in the ```Datasets``` section below.

## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Learn how to work in a team.
* Fork and manage your own git repository and avoid conflicts with your teammate's code.
* Ask yourself interesting questions related to your topic.
* Search and explore data that will help you answer your questions.
* Build a database.
* Perform a simple analysis and identify interesting insights.
* Focus on learning and developing Data Wrangling skills
* Learn something about Amsterdam!

## Initialization Steps
 - Divide up in groups
 - For each group one of the group members forks and clone this template repository and  and invites the   other group members to collaborate on the forked repository
 - The other group members accept the invitation, clone the forked repository and start collaborating on the same repository

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** deliverables and requirements that you must turn in are:
* Link to the repository you used while working on your project (see below for more details)
* Your repository must be clean and organized; this means that it must include a *.gitignore* file that blocks
  any images and datafiles, a README file and also have a functional file structure.
* The README file is based on the template you find here (in your_code folder)
  * Your README file must clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to find an answer to.
  * Your README file should include a link to your group's TRELLO board. The project must be planned. 
    That is why creating a Kanban board is important. 
    You can find a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/usAykV9K/project-2-barcelona). 
    **You are strongly advised not to start coding until your project is planned and your questions defined**
  * Your README must include **links** to all the raw files you used to complete your analysis. Remember to commit often to avoid trouble in case you mess up: this means more than 1 commit! The raw data can be stored on our google drive (see below) or you can provide a link that points to the original source of the data.
  * Your README file must include a **link** to the database you created starting from the raw files.The database file should be of type *.sql
  * Your README file should include a **link** to your Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) image that describes the structure of your database. You don't need to specify the data types of each column, only the tables you will create, the columns they have and the relationships between the tables. 
    Include the link to your ERD in your README file.
  * Your README file should contain a **link** to the project  presentation
* Your repository should contain a data folder for your data. **But the data should be used only locally not uploaded to the repository**. The links to the relevant data are placed in the jupyter analysis file that you are going to create for your project. The data are then to be downloaded and placed in the data folder. In your analysis remember to refer to the data folder in a relative way (for example '../data'), **do not use absolute paths**.
* **Please use the folder on our google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lm2AthW4EGtVpJxV5kmpDUw417cEoCov?usp=sharing) to store raw data, link to repository, databases, images and presentation files**. Please read the README files in the folders.
* The repository should contain only Jupyter and/or Python files with your analysis

## Please notice that:
**The database file and raw data files and images should be stored on our google drive not on repository** 
* Both the raw data and *.sql file should be accessible via the links your group provides
* You can make a database out of your raw data and use pandas to further manipulate the data or you can use sql techniques to work on the data.
*  **NO PLOTTING IS ALLOWED IN THIS PROJECT** because its main goal is data wrangling. You can make plots from your analysis dataframes for your power point presentations.
* The project needs to be presented to your colleagues on the day of the presentation.

The **deadline** to turn in the deliverables is right before the project presentations.
## Presentation time Saturday August 22th at **2 PM**! (last day of Module 1)

## Mentoring
Your teachers will be your mentors!

Your mentor will:
* Keep track of your project in general terms. Your mentor will be the second person that knows more about the project, after you.
* Check if you are following your plan: are you keeping up with your tasks and deadlines? Do you have any obstacles blocking you?
* Help/support you with specific questions.

Your mentors are **not** meant to:
* Know everything.
* Be your manager. You have to be responsible of your own tasks!

## Schedule

**Please note** that the following schedule is simply a guideline. Feel free to organize your work as you see fit.

**Phase 1**
* Choose your topic.
* Find interesting questions related to your topic.
* Brainstorm to find out what kind of data you can use to answer those questions.
* Research and look for the data you need. You can find some useful links to investigate in the ```Resources``` section.

**Phase 2**
* Plan your project. Remember that we are providing you with a Trello [template](https://trello.com/b/usAykV9K/project-2-barcelona). Define tasks, specifying those to be done individually and those to be done together. You are encouraged  **NOT TO CODE** until your project is planned.
* Once you finish, start coding!
* Clean your data.
* Design and build your database.

**Phase 3**
* Analyze your data.
* Find the most interesting and meaningful insights.
* Start preparing the slides for Saturday's presentation.

**Presentation**  
* Presentation time Saturday August 22th at **2 PM**! 

## Presentation
The presentation time limit is **10 minutes**! After each presentation, there will be a 3 minute Q&A. 

Our suggestion is to include at least the following slides in your presentation but feel free to add or remove slides:

* Title of the project
* Team presentation
* Goals of the project
* Data - sources, problems and limitations
* Database - data wrangling/cleaning and database structure
* Main insights
* Questions you were not able to answer and why
* Learnings

## Feedback

As with the labs, we will give you some general feedback on the project code and the way you presented your findings. 

## Tips & Tricks
* Questions first. Data second.
* Think about the workflow of your analysis BEFORE starting to code.
* You will have more questions than answers. It's not a problem if you can't answer some or any of your questions. Just show us why you couldn't answer them, that itself will be interesting!

## Asking Questions
Imagine that our project is about the population of Amsterdam.
We could, for example, try to answer a *descriptive* question such as: How many people are living in my neighborhood? In this case you will simply need to find data that can directly answer your question.
Let's instead assume that your question is an *analytic* one such as: Is my neighborhood the best? In this case you will need to think what the word *best* means in this context. For example it could mean:
* Safer
* More cultural events
* More schools
* ...

Analytic questions require you to think about the *how* of answering a question.
This is one of the most interesting parts of the process and you will be doing it for the rest of the bootcamp (and most likely for the rest of your career as a data analyst).
